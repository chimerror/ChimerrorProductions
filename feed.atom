		<title>VR Avatars Are Hard</title>
		<updated>2017-07-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;So the first thing I want in VR is an avatar. That is, I want to have a 3D model follow my body while I’m in VR. You’d think this would be common in VR, but it seems many VR experiences decide to skip it. In some regards, this is because it’s actually pretty hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first issue is that 3D models usually used for games have heads. You can in theory stick the camera into the head, but then you see the backside of head’s faces if it has any. Or as I was running into my most recent case, large eyeballs and modelled bangs. The solution to this is to keep the head “separate” from the body. But if you do that incorrectly, then your model has no head. You need the model to have a head when it’s making a shadow or being viewed in a mirror, but not otherwise. Unity actually has a “shadow only” setting for this, but you end up having to duplicate the head nonetheless. Either way, you need to be able to set this at modelling time, not after you have the model. That puts some limitations on your artist, and limits the ability to use characters modelled by others without some extra work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next issue is getting the gaze and body to sync up. This is actually not that hard. You have the model, you can transform it easily, and you have the information from the VR headset. The only things to keep in mind is that you want only the X and Z parts of the position, and only the rotation around the Y axis for the rotation. (We’re using Unity axes here, which are X to the right, Z forward, and Y up.) You might think the Y part of the position would be good for setting the height, but you then run into the next problem...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Height becomes a problem for two reasons. The first is that the position of the headset will move up and down slightly as you move around. The second is the more obvious fact that your players will be of different heights. I had a clever moment where I adjust the scaling of the Y axis so that the player is always the same height as the character. I’ve not moved it over to my new stack yet, but I’ll see if that can be automated rather than hard coded like it is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem with an avatar is performing the inverse kinematics (IK) for the hands and gaze. Well, in theory this is a problem, but Unity has IK libraries built in, so map the gaze to where the player is looking, and the hands to the hand controllers, and... Well, it works, but it’s still going to take fiddling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m however, going another level beyond that is kind of hard. I also have a LeapMotion controller, which is actually great at taking in hand motions. But I’ve not gotten that to work yet, I’ll keep playing with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this was just mainly a test post, but figured I’ll kill two birds with one stone!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>At Long Last, an Update</title>
		<updated>2017-07-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;I’m finally making an update to this website after so long of leaving it dormant. I would love to have this website be a place where I update often, and perhaps tied with my Patreon. Towards that end, starting tomorrow, I’m going to try to make more common work posts covering what I’m working on, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is both an update, and a test of my website pipeline. Don’t have much more to say.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Predators</title>
		<updated>2016-12-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;I began an interesting conversation on Twitter where I referred to abusive behavior within humans as predatory. Some of the people in the conversation were unpleased with the comparison, so I figured I'd think about it a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's always been interesting to me the general bias within the fandom towards carnivores and other predators. Some of me thinks it's due to our uneasy feelings about them compared to prey species. That is, some primal human memory of fearing them. And similar to our reported fascination with fire, I think there is a fear and desire to tame there. Our most popular pets, cats and dogs are an excellent example. Unlike the untamed power of wolves or lions, domestic dogs and cats have their viciousness aimed outwards. We enjoy having them around the same we enjoy being around a controlled fire. But it can rather quickly change if we're unlucky, and we know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when it comes to fursonas and other fantasies, I'm not surprised that we so often seek the violence that we cannot follow up on within our own society which has domesticated us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stand by that human nature is best understood as fierce egalitarianism within a limited social circle. This synthesizes the misleading Hobbesian view of constant competition with the also misleading noble savage view. We do have a strong sense of fairness, yes. But we also will enforce that fairness through vicious justice. Additionally, we retain an expectation that if the situation gets too dire, then open competition is likely. Ideally we'd just like to run competitors off, or resolve things through social conflict, as we know physical combat is extremely dangerous. But we're not naive to think it can be avoided forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be seen as a very negative view, but the saving grace comes in two ways. The first is the reluctance on both sides to get that far, and then, the rich human ability to create unifying structures through imagination. We have found a way for the generally complete strangers that make up civil society to work together to aid each other and see each other the same, as we would tribe and family. Society is itself, an adaptation to (hopefully) increase human survivability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But note that violence and combat are merely limited or sublimated, not truly excised. We train and engage in competitive play that mimics combat (both social and physical) without being as dangerous (usually).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I say there's a predatory nature in humans. But like domestic cats, it's a tenuous one that can easily flip to prey behavior when the upper hand is lost. Thus anger and fear are so highly linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back to furry. In my case, choosing a black leopard as my fursona was partially a thing of chance, but also a self recognition in what little I know about the animals, as well as their popular representation in media. To me, cats have a wonderful disregard for hiding their viciousness. You can watch big cats kept in captivity be loving towards handlers one moment, and then attempt to kill them the next. You can argue if this is actual aggression or aggressive play, but that's something appealing to me as a person who faces that daily as a minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tie of black leopards to the Black Panthers movement is also a reason why I associate myself with them. It is a mistake to regard the Black Panthers in the same way as the Ku Klux Klan. Both promise aggression, but in the case of the Klan, it's towards those who would civilly fight white supremacy, and in the Panthers it's towards those who use violence to enforce white supremacy. This is very different. It's &amp;quot;we will hurt you if you fail to prostrate yourself to us&amp;quot; versus &amp;quot;we will hurt you if you continue to attempt to hurt us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to me that's the amazing thing about the solitary leopard compared to other big cats. They speak softly but carry a big stick. The loud, brash lion, on the other hand speak loudly, and use the big stick much too eagerly, and lean on their pride mates to boot. Of course, that adoration of the leopard's independence comes at a huge dissonance with my actual human need for belonging and togetherness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the point is, it'd be a mistake for a leopard to not acknowledge their ability for violence, just as it would be a mistake for humans to. But that doesn't mean we must choose that violence, if we can instead find peace. And we often can. I point out our violent nature not to excuse, but to drive us to avoid it while keeping it close when needed. It's a road of balance and duality, as are most things in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;This originally appeared on Twitter. Slight edits have been made.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mark, did you ever watch &lt;em&gt;Alicia Cracks the Case&lt;/em&gt; as a kid? Y’know with the detective
squirrel?” Patty asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Aw yeah, I did! Watching that show was the first thing I did every time I came home from
school.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patty smiles. “Yeah, it was one of my favorites, too. One of the few shows my dad would let me
watch.” Patty turns in her chair to Mark, idly playing with one of her dreads. “Did I tell you
about Dad and cartoons?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark shakes his head, putting his phone to the side. “You said he was strict, but I don’t know
anything else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, he didn’t want me watching shows which didn’t teach me how to be a ‘proper lady’“ she
says with a flourish. “He was all ‘You already gonna be in trouble cause you black; you don’t
need to be a tomboy too!’ Though, he said ‘lesbo’ first until Mom yelled at him,” Patty adds,
her painted fingernails covering her chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, I certainly like you as a tomboy, but being a lesbo would be a problem for me as a man,”
he says, laughing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bah! I’ve seen your porn stash, I know it wouldn’t be that much of a problem. You can be a
catamite for my gang.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, right, you’re going to join a lesbian biker gang and let me be their boytoy servant. Beats
retail, I guess.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patty guffaws as Mark scratches the skin on his forearm. “Yeah, it does beat retail,
office boy… But there would be other benefits… Anyway, wanna know a secret about &lt;em&gt;Alicia&lt;/em&gt;?”
She says, leaning in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do tell, Ms. Patty, do tell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, Dad assumed I watched it because he thought I would see myself as Alicia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark nods. “I mean she was a very smart girl squirrel with amazing fashion sense, I can see
why.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You would focus on her fashion sense! But yeah, I liked her, but I really loved Scrum, her partner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The big rugby-playing cougar serving as her muscle? Li’l Mark related to his bravado hiding
his vulnerability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patty sighs, resting her face in her hand, dragging a claw across her cheek. “At first I wanted
him as a lover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I fit his description, don’t I?” Mark flexes his biceps, barely visible under the gray fur on
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sure sweetie, whatever…” Patty says, her pointed ears drooping a bit in mock support. Marc
grumbles and slumps back, before grabbing their comb to gussy up their tail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You wanted cougar-boy as a lover…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right. At first, that’s what I wanted.” Pat’s tail whips behind their back. “But that wasn’t
true… I wanted to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; him.” Pat admits, taking a moment to stretch their legs, splaying
their pawpads on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc stops combing to glare at Pat. “Didn’t I tell you to be careful with your claws on this
floor?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat picks up their legs in shock, wrapping their tawny arms around them. “Sorry, babe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s OK,” Marc says, returning to their combing. “So, you said you wanted to be him. What do
you mean?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat tilts their head, tapping their left canine with their flat tongue as they think. “I mean
what I mean. I didn’t love him as much as I wanted to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; him. I was pretty scrawny as a cub,
and got confused for a girl.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc nods, as Pat continues. “So while I liked being intelligent, I’d’ve traded it for a
strong body like his. I mean, at first, it was just a ‘tomboy’ thing, but then, well, it
became more than that. More… Just ‘boy’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc smiles, showing off their long incisors. “I understand that better than you’d think. I
was the ‘smart’ kid, a real nerd. So I felt a kinship with Alicia. There weren’t very many
black nerds on TV.” Marc’s tail curls around them. “I took what I could get, and if that was a
girly squirrel, well… Then call me a girly squirrel!” Marcia says, rising from her chair,
her bushy tail following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick laughs, crossing his arms across his chest. “And call me a sporty cougar!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“OK, you’re a sporty kitty.” Marcia says, bending over to kiss the cougar on his head. Patrick
guffaws, blushing. Marcia sits back down and the cougar continues to boggle. She smooths out
her dress while he recovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So yeah. That’s what I wanted to share with you.” Patrick says, turning back to the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Like how your football jumper shares your arms with me, Scrummy?” Marcia teases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, you know you like the gun show, Alicia,” the cougar retorts. “Just as much as you liked
that cartoon…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, it’s pretty obvious that a great detective like would me would have loved detective
shows as a pup. Though,” Alicia says, placing her phone in her paw, “Why would have &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;
liked &lt;em&gt;Patty and Mark Take The Case&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrum turns back to his computer, pulling his thin tail under his thigh, the black tip peeking
out the other side. “I have my reasons, Alicia. I have my reasons,” he says, “We all do. It’s
a case you’ll have to crack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alicia shakes her head while smiling. “Well, I have practice at that. You’re not that hard of
a case, Scrummy.”&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Temporary Site Created</title>
		<updated>2016-10-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;I've really begun to rat-hole on my own website implementation, so I've decided to force myself to
start from scratch using &lt;a href="http://wyam.io/"&gt;Wyam's&lt;/a&gt; basic blog recipe. There are aspects of it that
don't completely satisfy me, but I really need to move on from a likely long-term project doing web
work to producing things that make me happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also allows me to focus on some of the more important things I wanted for the site, like using
&lt;a href="http://pandoc.org/"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt; to be able to produce multiple versions of stories so readers can read
them in whatever format works best for them, whether that's online, on their phone, or on their
e-reader. I also have some need for finding a way to post to galleries, as well as my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chimerror"&gt;Twitter
feed&lt;/a&gt;. But for now, let's see what I can get done with as little work
as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably not the end of &lt;a href="https://github.com/foobardog/Borogove"&gt;Borogove&lt;/a&gt;, but a mere
deprioritization. Keep your ears perked and eyes scanning!&lt;/p&gt;
