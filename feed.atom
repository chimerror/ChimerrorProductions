&lt;p&gt;I've really begun to rat-hole on my own website implementation, so I've decided to force myself to
start from scratch using &lt;a href="http://wyam.io/"&gt;Wyam's&lt;/a&gt; basic blog recipe. There are aspects of it that
don't completely satisfy me, but I really need to move on from a likely long-term project doing web
work to producing things that make me happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also allows me to focus on some of the more important things I wanted for the site, like using
&lt;a href="http://pandoc.org/"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt; to be able to produce multiple versions of stories so readers can read
them in whatever format works best for them, whether that's online, on their phone, or on their
e-reader. I also have some need for finding a way to post to galleries, as well as my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chimerror"&gt;Twitter
feed&lt;/a&gt;. But for now, let's see what I can get done with as little work
as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably not the end of &lt;a href="https://github.com/foobardog/Borogove"&gt;Borogove&lt;/a&gt;, but a mere
deprioritization. Keep your ears perked and eyes scanning!&lt;/p&gt;
