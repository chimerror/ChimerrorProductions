<p>I began an interesting conversation on Twitter where I referred to abusive behavior within humans as predatory. Some of the people in the conversation were unpleased with the comparison, so I figured I'd think about it a bit more.</p>
<p>It's always been interesting to me the general bias within the fandom towards carnivores and other predators. Some of me thinks it's due to our uneasy feelings about them compared to prey species. That is, some primal human memory of fearing them. And similar to our reported fascination with fire, I think there is a fear and desire to tame there. Our most popular pets, cats and dogs are an excellent example. Unlike the untamed power of wolves or lions, domestic dogs and cats have their viciousness aimed outwards. We enjoy having them around the same we enjoy being around a controlled fire. But it can rather quickly change if we're unlucky, and we know that.</p>
<p>So when it comes to fursonas and other fantasies, I'm not surprised that we so often seek the violence that we cannot follow up on within our own society which has domesticated us.</p>
<p>I stand by that human nature is best understood as fierce egalitarianism within a limited social circle. This synthesizes the misleading Hobbesian view of constant competition with the also misleading noble savage view. We do have a strong sense of fairness, yes. But we also will enforce that fairness through vicious justice. Additionally, we retain an expectation that if the situation gets too dire, then open competition is likely. Ideally we'd just like to run competitors off, or resolve things through social conflict, as we know physical combat is extremely dangerous. But we're not naive to think it can be avoided forever.</p>
<p>This can be seen as a very negative view, but the saving grace comes in two ways. The first is the reluctance on both sides to get that far, and then, the rich human ability to create unifying structures through imagination. We have found a way for the generally complete strangers that make up civil society to work together to aid each other and see each other the same, as we would tribe and family. Society is itself, an adaptation to (hopefully) increase human survivability.</p>
<p>But note that violence and combat are merely limited or sublimated, not truly excised. We train and engage in competitive play that mimics combat (both social and physical) without being as dangerous (usually).</p>
<p>This is why I say there's a predatory nature in humans. But like domestic cats, it's a tenuous one that can easily flip to prey behavior when the upper hand is lost. Thus anger and fear are so highly linked.</p>
<p>So back to furry. In my case, choosing a black leopard as my fursona was partially a thing of chance, but also a self recognition in what little I know about the animals, as well as their popular representation in media. To me, cats have a wonderful disregard for hiding their viciousness. You can watch big cats kept in captivity be loving towards handlers one moment, and then attempt to kill them the next. You can argue if this is actual aggression or aggressive play, but that's something appealing to me as a person who faces that daily as a minority.</p>
<p>The tie of black leopards to the Black Panthers movement is also a reason why I associate myself with them. It is a mistake to regard the Black Panthers in the same way as the Ku Klux Klan. Both promise aggression, but in the case of the Klan, it's towards those who would civilly fight white supremacy, and in the Panthers it's towards those who use violence to enforce white supremacy. This is very different. It's &quot;we will hurt you if you fail to prostrate yourself to us&quot; versus &quot;we will hurt you if you continue to attempt to hurt us.&quot;</p>
<p>And to me that's the amazing thing about the solitary leopard compared to other big cats. They speak softly but carry a big stick. The loud, brash lion, on the other hand speak loudly, and use the big stick much too eagerly, and lean on their pride mates to boot. Of course, that adoration of the leopard's independence comes at a huge dissonance with my actual human need for belonging and togetherness.</p>
<p>But the point is, it'd be a mistake for a leopard to not acknowledge their ability for violence, just as it would be a mistake for humans to. But that doesn't mean we must choose that violence, if we can instead find peace. And we often can. I point out our violent nature not to excuse, but to drive us to avoid it while keeping it close when needed. It's a road of balance and duality, as are most things in life.</p>
