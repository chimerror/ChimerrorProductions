I've really begun to rat-hole on my own website implementation, so I've decided to force myself to
start from scratch using [Wyam's](http://wyam.io/) basic blog recipe. There are aspects of it that
don't completely satisfy me, but I really need to move on from a likely long-term project doing web
work to producing things that make me happy.

This also allows me to focus on some of the more important things I wanted for the site, like using
[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) to be able to produce multiple versions of stories so readers can read
them in whatever format works best for them, whether that's online, on their phone, or on their
e-reader. I also have some need for finding a way to post to galleries, as well as my [Twitter
feed](https://twitter.com/chimerror). But for now, let's see what I can get done with as little work
as possible.

This is probably not the end of [Borogove](https://github.com/foobardog/Borogove), but a mere
deprioritization. Keep your ears perked and eyes scanning!
