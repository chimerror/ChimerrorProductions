I’m finally making an update to this website after so long of leaving it dormant. I would love to have this website be a place where I update often, and perhaps tied with my Patreon. Towards that end, starting tomorrow, I’m going to try to make more common work posts covering what I’m working on, etc.

This post is both an update, and a test of my website pipeline. Don’t have much more to say.
